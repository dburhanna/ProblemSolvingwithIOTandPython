# Write your code here :-)
# BLE ideas
#1 - connect to phone and use it to turn on/off LED using app buttons
#    - BLE background, client/server, central/peripheral, packets

#2 - connect to phone as UART and receive data from step counter - use an arrow for reset and an arrow for current steps?

#3 - stream data from another sensor and plot on phone?
#4 - connect to computer and make custom UART protocol(?) to send data from another sensor,
#     store data to a file or plot
