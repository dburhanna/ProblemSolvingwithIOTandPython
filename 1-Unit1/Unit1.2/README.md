# Unit 1.2

Unit 1.2 discusses IoT Connectivity.  An IoT device is not very useful if it can not connect in 
someway to the internet. The device may not be connected at all times, but at some point the d
evice will need to connect to send and receive data or commands.

The following common connectivity types of IoT systems are presented:

* Ethernet
* WiFi
* BLE
* Cellular
* Zigbee
* LoRa

The curriculum labs will explore both BLE and WiFi connectivity using the Adafruit Feather 
Sense hardware device.
