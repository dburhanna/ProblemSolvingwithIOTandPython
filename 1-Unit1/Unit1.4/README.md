# Unit 1.4

Unit 1.4 discusses IoT Services. IoT “Services” are the software packages you use to help make your 
IoT device truly useful.  An IoT service could be an online application, or it could be custom 
software that you write yourself to help store or visualize data from your IoT device.

The following IoT services are discussed:

* Store and/or Retrieve Data
* Process device data
* Visualize Data
* Coordinate communication between devices
* Allow IoT device configuration
* Provide a User Interface for technician access
* Allow the device to communicate with non IoT websites

The curriculum labs will explore custom IoT services and online IoT services.  
In particular the services provided by  free accounts at Adafruit IO will be used.
