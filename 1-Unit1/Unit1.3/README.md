# Unit 1.3

Unit 1.3 discusses IoT Communication Protocols.  Even if an IoT device can connect to the internet, 
it is still not very useful if it can not communicate in an understood language with other 
software or devices.

The following common communication protocols of IoT systems are presented:

* HTTP with ReST urls
* MQTT with Topics
* CoAP

The curriculum labs will explore IoT communication with UART, HTTP ReST, and the MQTT 
with topics protocols using the Adafruit Feather Sense hardware device.
