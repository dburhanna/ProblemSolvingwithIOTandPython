Unit 1.1 begins a comprehensive introduction to Internet of Things concepts. In particular Unit 1.1 
seeks to answer the question, "what is a thing?"

A history of IoT is presented and IoT applications, current and future are discussed.  The expected 
commercial markets are also presented. The unit concludes with a presentation of a variety of 
different views on the architecture of an IoT system.  Depending on who you ask, you will almost 
always get a different answer.
