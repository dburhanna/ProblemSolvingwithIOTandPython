# Unit 6 - Final Project

I believe it is important to give students a chance to explore and apply new skills and knowledge
in a way that they feel is important or relevant.  Teachers should schedule time at the end of the
semester for students to work on a "Final Project" of their own choosing.

The previous labs in the curriculum have exposed students to a variety of connectivity types
and a variety of communication protocols.  Challenge students to use their creativity to come
up with a meaningful project.

Purchasing a variety of extra FeatherWings opens up many other IoT device possibilities for
the students to explore.  The Final Project pre-lab should give students lots of possibilities
to consider.
