# Unit 4 Lab 8 - BLE with the MQTT Gateway

Unit 4 Lab 8 exposes the students to the MQTT communication protocol. Students will also experience 
the Adafruit IO Internet of Things service for the first time.  Students will connect their IoT 
devices via BLE to the cellphone application and then use the cellphone as an MQTT gateway to the Internet.

The Lab 8 pre-lab presents an important introduction to MQTT concepts and terminology.  Teachers should 
familiarize themselves with Adafruit IO and the creation of free user accounts prior to the Lab 8 pre-lab.
