# Unit 4 - BLE Connectivity

Unit 4 will introduce students to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity for IoT devices. 
The Adafruit Feather Sense has BLE hardware built-in.  Before students can use BLE in the labs, 
a few additional modules must be added to the \lib folder on the Feather Sense.  Students 
will add these modules themselves at the beginning of Lab 6.

Teachers should prepare to distribute the following modules to students for use in Lab 6:

* adafruit_ble
* adafruit_ble_adafruit
* adafruit_bluefruit_connect
*
