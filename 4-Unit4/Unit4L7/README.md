# Unit 4 Lab 7 - Explore more BLE

Unit 4 Lab 7 continues to expose the students to BLE connectivity.  In Lab 6 students used predefined 
communication standards so the IoT device understood the connected appplication.  In Lab 7 they will 
create custom commands using a more general UART standard.  They will then connect the IoT device to a 
computer with BLE.  Most Apple based computers have built-in BLE but if your desktop computer does not, 
I found the following USB - BLE dongles to work very well for Windows based machines:

The Lab 7 pre-lab presents concepts of BLE security and BLE power consumption.
