# Unit 5 Lab 9 - Intro to WiFi and HTTP

Unit 5 Lab 9 introduces students to WiFi connectivity and the HTTP communication protocol. Students 
will connect the IoT device to a local access point for internet connectivity.  The creation of 
a "secrets.py" file for storage of usernames and passwords is an important component to IoT security.

The Lab 9 pre-lab presents an introduction to both WiFi connectivity and the HTTP communication protocol.
