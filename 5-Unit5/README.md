# Unit 5 - WiFi Connectivity

Unit 5 will introduce students to WiFi connectivity for IoT devices. The Adafruit Feather Sense does 
not have built-in WIFi hardware but by attaching the Airlift FeatherWing to the Adafruit Feather Sense 
device the capability has been there, waiting to be used.  Before students can use WiFi in the labs, 
a few additional modules must be added to the \lib folder on the Feather Sense.  Students will 
add these modules themselves at the beginning of Lab 9.

Teachers should prepare to distribute the following modules to students for use in Lab 9:

* adafruit_esp32spi
* adafruit_requests.mpy
