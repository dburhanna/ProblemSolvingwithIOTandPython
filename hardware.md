# The T in IoT

To truly learn about IoT students should use a real "thing", a real device that interacts with the world around them. Beginning with Unit 3, every IoT lab in 
my curriculum is based on real-world hardware available to the school or students from Adafruit Industries. 

The physical hardware chosen from Adafruit is the **Adafruit Feather Sense** plus the **Adafruit AirLift FeatherWing**.  The Feather Sense board is great 
because it is completely packed with sensors for the students to use. During this course, students will not have to worry about wiring diagrams and connecting 
external sensors.  The Feather Sense has everything built right in.  The Feather Sense combined with the AirLift provide the student the ability to:

- connect via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- connect via WiFi
- sense temperature
- sense barometric pressure/altitude
- sense humidity
- sense sound
- sense light, proximity, color and gestures
- sense 9-DoF motion with an acceleration/gyroscopic + a magnetometer

**All of this for about $50!**

## Optional hardware

<!--
The lessons on automated watering work using a relay. As an option, you can connect this relay to a water pump powered by USB using the hardware listed below.

* [6V water pump](https://www.seeedstudio.com/6V-Mini-Water-Pump-p-1945.html)
* [USB terminal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3628)
* Silicone pipes
* Red and black wires
* Small flat-head screwdriver

## Virtual hardware

The virtual hardware route will provide simulators for the sensors and actuators, implemented in Python. Depending on your hardware availability, you can run this on your normal development device, such as a Mac, PC, or run it on a Raspberry Pi and simulate only the hardware you don't have. For example, if you have the Raspberry Pi camera but not the Grove sensors, you will be able to run the virtual device code on your Pi and simulate the Grove sensors, but use a physical camera.

The virtual hardware will use the [CounterFit project](https://github.com/CounterFit-IoT/CounterFit).

To complete these lessons you will need to have a web cam, microphone and audio output such as speakers or headphones. These can be built in or external, and need to be configured to work with your operating system and available for use from all applications.
