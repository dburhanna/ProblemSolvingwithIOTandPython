# Unit 3 Lab 5 - Explore the Adafruit Feather Sense

Unit 3 Lab 5 introduces the students to all the built-in sensors on the Feather Sense.  
Students should recognize how easy CircuitPython makes it to use these "inputs". Students will 
list all the CircuitPython modules installed in the \lib folder on the Feather Sense and 
connect each of the modules with the specific hardware on the Feather Sense device.
