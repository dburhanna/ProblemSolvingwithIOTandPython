#Unit 3 Lab 4 - Intro to CircuitPython

Unit 3 Lab 4 introduces the students to the IoT hardware device and to CircuitPython (CP).  The pre-lab 
prepares the students with some background on microcontroller devices and a brief history of the 
development of CircuitPython.

In Lab 4 students are exposed to the CP Read Evaluate Print Loop(REPL). They should understand the 
CP REPL works like a REPL for regular Python with the same basic functionality.  Students will 
import modules into the REPL, create objects and then use the objects to control hardware components 
on the Feather Sense.  Students will work with a few "output" possibilities available on the Feather Sense.

Lab 4 will again emphasize the following steps:

1. import a CP module
2. create a new object
3. use methods and attributes of the new object to get stuff done
