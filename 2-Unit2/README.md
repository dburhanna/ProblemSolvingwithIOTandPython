# Unit 2 - Python Programming

Unit 2 provides a quick review of some key concepts of the Python programming language that I feel 
are key to working with this curriculum.  This unit is not meant to be a complete introduction 
programming.  It is assumed students have had at least an introductory course in programming is 
some high-level language text-based language.
