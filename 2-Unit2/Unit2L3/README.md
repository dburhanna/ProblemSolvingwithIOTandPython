# Unit 2 Lab 3

Unit 2 Lab 3 introduces the students to Python file handling.  In Python, files are objects, 
so this lab is a great follow-up to Lab 2.  Lab 3 should reinforce the concepts of Object Oriented 
Programming (OOP) the students will use in many future labs.  In Lab 3 students write code to 
store some data to a file.  This is a step towards a future custom IoT service.
