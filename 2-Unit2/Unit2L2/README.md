# Unit 2 Lab 2 - Python Objects and Methods

Unit 2 Lab 2 introduces the students to the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  Python 
is object oriented through and through but most course teaching Python do not present 
object oriented programming at all.  Lab 2 will not make the students experts in OOP 
but I hope to expose the students to a few big ideas which they can then recognize and 
use again in many future labs.  This is a key lab to remind the students about Computational 
Thinking, in particular the pattern recognition step.  I want students to recognize OOP concepts 
in action and to be able to apply them again using a similar pattern.  In Lab 2 students write 
programs using Tracy the Turtle to act as a paradigm of the OOP process in action.

Lab 2 aims to help the students recognize the following steps:

1. import a python module
2. create a new object
3. use methods and attributes of the new object to get stuff done
