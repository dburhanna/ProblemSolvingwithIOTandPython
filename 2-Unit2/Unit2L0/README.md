# Unit 2 Lab 0

Unit 2 Lab 0 introduces the student to the Mu Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
and the Python Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL).  The Mu editor was written specifically 
to be used in an educational setting.  It is a simplified IDE but it maintains powerful 
features of more complicated IDEs such as a built in plotter and a debugger.  Mu can also 
be run in different modes allowing the use of a common IDE for both Python programming and 
CircuitPython programming in future labs.  Lab 0 will also remind students of the six basic 
programming abilities found in every programming language.

Lab 0 will be the first time students venture into the lab space so time should be spent on 
familiarizing them with the computers Mu is running on, safety rules, etc.
